# Sindhi Interpreter

This is a passion project that aims to make Sindhi more accessible to the youth
or any other group of Sindhis who find it difficult to read Sindhi Script.

This project will tackle a few challenges, initially:

- [ ] Creating an standardized list of Roman/Latin characters to represent
      Sindhi letter, usually represented by Perso-Arabic Alphabet.
- [ ] Create a modern text-editor component with ability to interpret the
      Romanized Sindhi scirpt to Perso-Arabic Script, and vice-versa.
      Features: - [ ] Hover over any word to get the Romanized Sindhi word or the
      Perso-Arabic Sindhi word, depending on the current state. - [ ] Ability to switch between the scripts for reading and writing.
